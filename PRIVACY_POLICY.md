# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** November 27, 2024

## Overview

Chat Exporter is a browser extension that exports Microsoft Teams chat conversations. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles your data.

**The short version: We don't collect anything. Period.**

## Data Collection

This extension does **not** collect, store, transmit, or share any data whatsoever. Specifically:

## How the Extension Works

The extension operates entirely within your browser:

1. It reads chat messages that are already visible on your screen in Microsoft Teams
2. It formats those messages into a file (JSON or TXT)
3. It saves that file directly to your computer via your browser's download function

All processing happens locally on your device. No data ever leaves your browser.

- Never leaves your device
- Is not transmitted anywhere
- Can be cleared by removing the extension or clearing browser data
